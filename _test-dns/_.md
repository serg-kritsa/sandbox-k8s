- Create the backend Deployment:
> kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/backend-deployment.yaml

- - View information about the backend Deployment:
> kubectl describe deployment backend

- Create the backend Service:
> kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/backend-service.yaml

- Create the frontend Deployment and Service:
> kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/frontend-deployment.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/frontend-service.yaml

- Interact with the frontend Service
Once you've created a Service of type LoadBalancer, you can use this command to find the external IP:
> kubectl get service frontend --watch

- Send traffic through the frontend
The frontend and backend are now connected. You can hit the endpoint by using the curl command on the external IP of your frontend Service.
> curl http://${EXTERNAL_IP} # replace this with the EXTERNAL-IP you saw earlier
The output shows the message generated by the backend:
> {"message":"Hello"}

- Cleaning up
To delete the Services, enter this command:
> kubectl delete services frontend hello backend
To delete the Deployments, the ReplicaSets and the Pods that are running the backend and frontend applications, enter this command:
> kubectl delete deployment frontend backend
